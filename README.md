# Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting mental health conditions using machine learning techniques. Various classification models were implemented and compared based on accuracy, precision, and recall scores. Additionally, ensemble learning techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking were applied to improve the performance of the best-performing model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Implementation of multiple classification models
- Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, and recall scores
- Application of ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Selection of the best model for prediction

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- MLxtend

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
4. **Extra Trees Classifier**
5. **MLP Classifier (Neural Network)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **Na√Øve Bayes (GaussianNB)**
8. **Bagging Classifier**
9. **AdaBoost Classifier**
10. **Stacking Classifier**

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Precision-Recall Curve**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Cross-Validation Score**

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-prediction.git
cd mental-health-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script to execute the model training and evaluation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Results
The models were evaluated based on their classification performance, and the best-performing model was selected using ensemble techniques. The combination of stacking, bagging, and boosting further enhanced the predictive power of the final model.
